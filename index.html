            <h2>Brief Bio</h2>
			 <p>
                Currently, I serve as an Associate Professor at the State Key Laboratory of Complex & Critical Software Environment at NUDT, China.
            </p>
            <p>
                I received my Ph.D. degree from Université Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France, working with Prof. Bruce Denby and Prof. Gerard Dreyfus (IEEE Fellow). My research focuses on <strong>Multimodal machine learning</strong>, <strong>Computer audition</strong>, and <strong>AI4Science</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to academic pursuits, I actively participate in machine learning competition, having achieved top ranks in data mining and machine learning competitions, including the <a href="https://www.kdd.org/kdd2017/announcements/view/announcing-kdd-cup-2017-highway-tollgates-traffic-flow-prediction target="_blank">ACM KDD Cup</a>, Kaggle, Tianchi, and CCF BDCI. I am also a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kelexu/competitions" target="_blank"><strong>Kaggle Grandmaster</strong></a>.
